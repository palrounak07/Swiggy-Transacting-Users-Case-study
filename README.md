📌 Problem Statement

Swiggy acquires millions of users, but a significant portion of them remain casual or inactive.
Out of a large base of daily new and inactive users, only a small fraction completes transactions, leading to lost revenue potential.

Goal:
Understand why casual users do not transact frequently and design product features that encourage repeat ordering and long-term engagement
